    # dconf is a simple key-value store that GNOME uses to store user preferences.
    # All preferences are stored in a binary database file.
    # Layering of preferences is possible using multiple files.
    # For example, user defaults can be stored in one file, while system defaults can be stored in another.
    #
    # A profile is a list of binary database files that dconf searches to find the value for a key.
    # The first database in the list is the database used to write changes, while the remaining databases are read-only.

        # A system-db line specifies a system database. The system database files are stored in /etc/dconf/db.
        # The user database takes the highest priority, followed by the system databases in the given order.
        #
        # The service-db line instructs dconf to synchronize the user database with a plain text keyfile ~/.config/dconf/user.txt.
        # This keyfile can be modified using a text editor, and backed up using a backup tool.
        #
        # Each system database has a corresponding keyfile directory that has the same name as the database file with a .d extension.
        # For example, the keyfile directory /etc/dconf/db/local.d contains keyfiles for the /etc/dconf/db/local database.
        #
        # After modifying a keyfile, run "dconf update" to update the databases.
